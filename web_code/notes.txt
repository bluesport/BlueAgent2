The following link is really helpful to understand the project setup: http://www.pro-react.com/materials/appendixA/. Cred @ Lukas.

To start server:
	node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server

If you encounter a 404 error, try:
	losf -w -n -i tcp:8080
	kill -9 [problematic PID]

Alternatively:
	killall -9 node
