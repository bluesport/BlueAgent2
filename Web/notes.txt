The following link is really helpful to understand the project setup: http://www.pro-react.com/materials/appendixA/. Cred @ Lukas.

Donâ€™t forget:
	npm install

To start server:
	npm start

If you encounter an error, first try npm install. If you still get the error:
	losf -w -n -i tcp:8080
	kill -9 [problematic PID]

Alternatively:
	killall -9 node
